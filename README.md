determining whether or not a particular pair of questions on the Quora platform are similar, or whether one is a duplicate of another. 
Applied NLP techniques for feature engineering.
For modeling, applied ML algorithms ensembles like random forest and Xgboost .
The visualisation and results of ML models without preprocessing are contained in one folder, whereas those of ML models with preprocessing and advanced features are contained in another folder. Random forest is the superior model in both scenarios, although after preprocessing, it performs more accurately than without.
